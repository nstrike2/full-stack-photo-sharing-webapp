# full-stack-photo-sharing-webapp
This is a photo sharing web app build using ReactJS, NodeJS/ExpressJS, HTML/CSS, and MongoDB, enabling users to interact with profiles, comments, and photos, with functionality to upload photos/comments.

I utilized ReactJS/JSX to build front-end UI and enable dynamic view switching, using the Material-UI framework to style a mobile responsive page.

I Employed NodeJS to build a back-end web server, using the ExpressJS framework to construct a REST API and MongoDB to store user data.

Enjoy!
